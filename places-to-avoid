When visiting Hamburg, there are a few areas that tourists might consider avoiding, especially after dark or if they are unfamiliar with the city. Here are some neighborhoods to be cautious about:

- Make sure to avoid the area around the central train station (Hauptbahnhof) in Hamburg! Especially in the night.
- St. Pauli: While famous for the Reeperbahn nightlife district, parts of St. Pauli can be sketchy, especially late at night. Be mindful of your surroundings and stay in well-lit areas.
- Wilhelmsburg: This area has seen some regeneration, but it still has a reputation for higher crime rates. It's best to visit during the day and stick to main streets.
- Veddel: Similar to Wilhelmsburg, Veddel is undergoing change but is known for higher levels of social issues. Caution is advised, especially at night.
- Harburg: This district is further from the city center and has some areas that are less tourist-friendly. Visiting during the day is generally safer.
