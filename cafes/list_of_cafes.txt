- Frau Larsson: brings a bit of Sweden to Winterhude. Enjoy home-made cinnamon buns, smorgasbord or pancakes. The coffee and cake can be enjoyed in the afternoon - it feels like a short Scandinavian vacation whether cosy indoors or relaxing on the outdoor beach chairs (Peter-Marquard-Straße 13)

- Unter den Linden: A little place in the middle of the bustling Schanzenviertel! The cafe got home-made cakes and dishes since 1982, quit a long time. It´s better to visit in summer because you can relax on the terrace with a coffee or beer. Add on: there a lot of newspaper and magazines, so if you go there on your own you´ll never get bored (Juliusstraße 16)

- Zuckermonarchie: A quiet and small cafe is on the Taubenstraße, so on the Reeperbahn. They have a lot of sweets, e.g. cake pops, cupcakes and other delicious sweet treats. You can enjoy your cake with a hot or cold drink. (Taubenstraße 15)

- Torrefaktum Rosatery: This is a local bio-certified coffee roastery - apart from coffee and snacks, you can take part in coffee seminars (sounds fun right?). This cafe has journalistic roots, so you can enjoy talks and books there.
